    <img src="sekirov3.jpg" alt="logo">
    <p>I wasn't really sure what topic to choose, so I just decided to do something based on
        the game I'm currently playing, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.  I knew I wanted the image
        to have a border, as I wanted to play around with some kind of pseudo-3d effect, but 
        after I did that I realized that it looked more like a poster than a magazine.  I 
        also realized that I needed more images than just the one, so I added another and 
        made them blend together using photo masks.  I also knew I wanted the stylized japanese
        title somewhere in the image, but I could only find bad quality versions of it.  To 
        work around this, I traced it by hand and remade it from scratch.  Lastly, I wanted to
        make it look at least a little like a magazine, so I added the PC Gamer logo.  I kinda
        regret not adding more text to the image, but it is what it is.
