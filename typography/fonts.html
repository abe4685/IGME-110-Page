<h1>Typography Exercise</h1>
<p>We have a wide range of facilities including those you would expect from an 
high quality camp site â€“ electric hook ups, shower and toilet block and laundry room. 
We also have a recreation block which is home to a games room with pool table, 
TV room and 10m swimming pool. Situated next to the recreation block are two 
outdoor tennis courts. </P>

<blockquote>Wow, those sure were some words!</blockquote>

<p>You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine 
with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. There was a war. 
A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for 
the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. 
My family. My friends. Even that sky. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... 
But don't ever mistake that for nice. There's something else I've always wanted to say: 
Allons-y, Alonso!</p>
