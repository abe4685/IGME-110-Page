<p>I've been playing a lot of Risk of Rain 2 this past month, so I decided to make a little fan trailer for it.  I wanted it to show off all the characters that are currently playable, as well as a variety of different enemies and environments
    I also wanted to use music from the game as the BGM, so I chose a track that fit the tone I was going for.  In the game, the music I used plays when fighting a boss, and the music reflects that by giving off an intense vibe.  In the middle 
    of the trailer when the shot switches between all the playable characters, I wanted to use minimal transitions to reflect the fast paced nature of the game.
